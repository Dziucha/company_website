The suggested git workflow:
1. Create a new branch `<your_branch>` from `main` or `another remote branch`.
2. Develop any changes needed on local `<your_branch>` branch.
3. Checkout `main` (`another remote branch`) branch and pull the changes.
4. Checkout `<your_branch>` and merge `main`/`another remote branch` **into** `<your_branch>`.
5. Push `<your_branch>` to remote repository.
6. Create a **Pull Request** and assign reviewers and assignees.
7. Apply review feedback locally and apply steps 3.-5 as many times as needed.
8. Push new changes to remote `<your_branch>` and resolve discussions.
8. Merge with at least 1 approval (preferably 2).
